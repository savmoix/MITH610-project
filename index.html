    <h1>My project</h1>
    <div id="description"><p>The editorial articles chosen for my encoding project are bold and honest as far as race relations went at UMD and nationally in the late 1960s. They engage the narrative voices and viewpoints of African Americans and Caucasian identities, which was interesting for me. Though there is an overwhelming sympathy constructed for black people in the first article, the second serves as a more moderate balancing act of attempting to understand the distinctive advantages and disadvantages of white and black people in order to reach a more equitable end. Both articles were written by an African American UMD student, Mike McNair, who became notorious for his editorials on race and the black experience at the university. In terms of my encoding, I focus on racial identities as portrayed at UMD, among campus groups, and, more broadly, in the United States.</p>
<p>In the first article, "Average reaction blacks get on a daily basis," McNair writes under the pseudonym "I.A. Racist" from "Bigot, Maryland" and pens a heated letter that describes his personal frustrations with black students at UMD. Toward the end of the article, McNair adopts a narrative voice, depicting I.A. Racist as "Whitey," who "must be stopped" in his efforts to tear down the black community. My encoding efforts focused on teasing out racial identities and affiliated descriptions of those groups. Identities I paid special attention to via interpretation groups included "#AFAM", "#CAUC", and "#OTHER," the first two being the most common. Particular affiliated names and titles have been encoded as slurs when they read as derogatory and increasingly insulting. These include “#ASLUR” (in reference to African Americans) and the lesser-used “#CSLUR” (in reference to Caucasians). I felt it was important to retain these slurs so that I could encode a variety of racial identifiers – those that are commonplace to modern readers and those that make us cringe upon reading. It is with care that I attempt to delineate “blacks” with “savages” or “niggers,” though all can be used in despicable ways.</p>
<p>Similarly, my mark-up of the second article, “Understand Whitey,” features racial identifier and UMD references, as well as racial slurs. Here, McNair speaks more broadly about the divisiveness between black and white communities, teasing out the opportunities (or lack thereof) afforded to each. “#CAUC” people have access to affiliated terms and ideas such as “numerous vocational opportunities” and “strong family structures,” unlike “#AFAM” folks. I try to mirror McNair’s categories and lists with my own encoding – which groups are afforded what “lacks” and “luxuries.” In contrast to the first article, I created an additional interpretation group that pointed out actions (“#ACT”) being taken that seem to highlight or exacerbate racial difference. In a couple of instances, civil rights leaders are “pointing” at injustices and “white America” is “screaming” racism and “name-calling.” In this article, McNair is attempting to introduce ways to come together or, at the very least, take actions to recognize the great racial divide between Americans. Thus, I felt it was important to encode moments of past, current, and future actions of those involved, as McNair depicts them.</p>
<p>In bringing attention to various identities and stressing their voices (sometimes direct dialogues, as written in the articles), I am attempting to reimagine an archive that stresses both people/groups and their experiences. McNair speaks generally about the racist realities of growing up white and growing up black, but he also highlights specific moments of specific segregation and racial tension as experienced by African American students on UMD’s campus. The latter seems necessary in order avoid troping and trivializing “the black experience,” which is often done by folks in hegemonic societal standings like I.A. Racist (and, dare I say, the archive).</p>
