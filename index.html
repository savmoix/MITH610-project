    <h1>My project</h1>
    <div id="description">Both articles were written by an African American UMD student, Mike McNair, who became notorious for his editorials on race and the black experience at the university (and beyond).<lb break="yes"/>
      In the first article, "Average reaction blacks get on a daily basis," McNair writes under the pseudonym "I.A. Racist" from "Bigot, Maryland" and pens a heated letter that describes his personal frustrations with black students at UMD. Toward the end of the article, McNair adopts a narrative voice, depicting I.A. Racist as "Whitey," who "must be stopped" in his efforts to tear down the black community.My encoding efforts focused on teasing out racial identities and affiliated descriptions of those groups. Identities I paid special attention to via interpretation groups included "#AFAM", "#CAUC", and "#OTHER," the first two being the most common. Particular affiliated names and titles have been encoded as slurs when they read as derogatory and increasingly insulting.<lb break="yes"/>
    In the second article, "Understand whitey," McNair speaks more broadly about the divisiveness between black and white communities, teasing out the opportunities (or lack thereof) afforded to each.</div>
